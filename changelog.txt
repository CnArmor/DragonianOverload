0.4.0
- Optimized Work Giver for an insignificant amount, but hey, an optimize is an optimize.

- Added self-milking to dragonian. (le,lewd!)

0.3.0
- Patched dragonian weapon restriction. Now dragonians can equip all non-race-restricted melee weapons, even modded ones!
	- This is done by patching HAR racce restriction and should theoretically work with all mods without needing furhter patching.
	- They still refuse to shoot. Yes I made them this way.

0.2.2
- Actually implemented working melee damage multiplier and melee weapon cooldown multiplier.

- Changed method of granting ability to dragonian.

0.2.1
- Added visual effect and sound to Dragonblood Overload.

0.2.0
- Added new ability to Dragonians. Introducing Dragonblood Overload! This grants dragonians massive combat buffs but leaves permanent burn on brain and heart.
	- Dragonblood Overload: 
		- When activated, granting the folowing buffs:
			+50% Consciousness
			+50% Blood Pumping
			+2 Move Speed
			-50% Incoming Damage
			x120% Melee Damage
			x60% Melee Cooldown
		- Hoever also causing the following drawbacks:
 			x150% Bleeding Factor
			Every 3~5 seconds, leave permanent burn of 0.2~0.4 point on brain (33% chance) or heart (67% chance)
		- Lasts for 4 hours (167 seconds).
		- Cooldown 1 day.
		- On average takes about 7 days for the permanent burns to be healed by Auto Recovery. (soft cooldown)
		- Won't damage brain or heart below 20%, but at that point your dragonian would be downed after ability ended.
		- Also extreme high risk of death from bleeding and other sources of damage.

- Nerfed Dragonian raw combat capacity accordingly. Overall you should have more power when using Dragonblood Overload, but it comes with a cost.
	- baseHealthScale: 3 -> 1.8
	- Fist attack and teeth attack power: 18 -> 14
	- Tail attack power: 20 -> 16

0.1.0
- Completely rewrote the code for Auto Recovery. More customizable through xml and added drawbacks when healing permanent scars.
	- Auto Recovery:
		- When permanent scar exists, becomes active and cause +50% hunger rate & +20% rest fall rate.
		- Heals a random scar for 0.1~0.3 points every 2~3 in game hours.
		- All mentioned above adjustable through xml.

0.0.1
- Merged Dragonian_Female and Dragonian_Male into one race.
	-Some defNames are kept as *_Female for legacy and compatibility reason.

- Male dragonians have distinct face now.

- Added 1 male dragonian hairstyle, retracted from dragonian animal mod.

- Added bionic tail attack to bionic tail.
	- Bionic tail attack can briefly stun the enemy it hits.
	- Power 22, cooldown 3

- Dragonian apparels are now categorized.

- Removed Harmony patch to keep apparels color always white. This now uses vanilla method. Also rewrote DR_Apparel.xml to achieve that.
